# Confidentiality with Symmetric Encryption
1. Symmetric encryption
   - Providing confidentiality for transmitted or stored data
   - Conventional encryption or single-key encryption
2. Two requirements for its secure use
   - A strong encryption algorithm
   - Opponent: **Unable to decrypt ciphertext or discover the key**, (given pairs of ciphertexts and plaintexts, as well as the algorithm)
   - Secure **key distribution and maintenance**

3. Attacking Symmetric Encryption

4. Data Encryption Standard (DES)

5. Brute-Force Attacks against DES

6. Triple DES (3DES)

7. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

8. Symmetric Block Encryption Algorithms
