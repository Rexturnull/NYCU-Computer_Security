# Fundamental Security Design Principles
1. Economy of mechanism
   Design should be as simple and small as possible
2. Fail-safe defaults
   Access decisions should be based on permission rather than exclusion
3. Complete mediation
   Every access must be checked against the access control mechanism
4. Open design
   Design should be open rather than secret 
   (e.g., widespread adoption of **NIST-approved algorithms**)
5. Separation of privilege
   Separate users and processes based on different levels of trust, needs, and privilege requirements
6. Least privilege
   Every process and every user of the system should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to perform the task
7. Least common mechanism
   Design should minimize the functions shared by different users for mutual security
8. Psychological acceptability
   Should not interfere unduly with the work of users or hinder the usability or accessibility of resources
9. Isolation
   - Resources at public access systems 
   - Processes and files of individual users
   - Security mechanisms 
10. Encapsulation
   **A specific form of isolation based on object-oriented functionality**,(e.g., Packet Header)
11. Modularity
    - Development of security functions as separate, protected modules
    - Use of a modular architecture for mechanism design and implementation
12. Layering
    Use of multiple, overlapping protection approaches
13. Least astonishment
    A program or user interface should always respond in the way that is least likely to astonish the user

# Attack Surfaces and Attack Trees
## Attack Surfaces
1. Consist of the reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities in a system
   - Network attack surface
     - Network protocol vulnerabilities
     - e.g., open ports on outward facing Web and other servers
   - Software attack surface
      - Vulnerabilities in application, utility,or operating system code
      - e.g., interfaces, SQL, and web forms
   - Human attack surface
     - Vulnerabilities created by personnel
     -  e.g., an employee with access to sensitive info vulnerable to a social engineering attack
2. Why is an attack surface analysis useful?
   - Assess the scale and severity of threats to a system
   - Make developers aware of where security mechanisms are required

## Attack Trees
1. A branching, hierarchical data structure: a set of potential techniques for exploiting security vulnerabilities
   - Root: the attack goal
   - Leaf: different ways to initiate an attack
   -  Each node (other than a leaf) is either an AND-node or an OR-node

2. Using attack trees
   - To effectively exploit the info available on attack patterns
   - To document security attacks in a structured form that reveals key vulnerabilities
   - To guide both the design of systems/apps and countermeasures
